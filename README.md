This project is used to transfer tokens from one ropsten testnet account to another one.
Every account can mint 100 oleanji token once and it can be used to send messages from one to another while also sending Oleanji tokens.

After a successful transaction record is kept and shown you can view the transaction on ethersacan from a link prvided, the message sent or received, the account sending and receiving and the time of transaction.

the UI for this project is way under top notch but it serves it purpose well. It can be said to be a mini Trust wallet for Oleanji tokens. :)

The Contract Address of Oleanji Token is provided in the page copy and paste that in your metamask account (ropsten)


To add ropsten to your metamask :
1. Open MetaMask extension and click on the dropdown icon of the network name. I see a list of Ether networks.

2. Click "[Show/Hide] test networks" link. I see the "Show test networks" switch.

3. Turn on the "Show test networks" switch. I see test works listed.

4. Select "Ropsten Test Network" as the current network.


Requirements:
1) Have a metamask extension on your browser (preferably chrome)
2) have multiple Ropsten accounts.
3) The accounts should be funded with ropsten eth.
4) The Ropsten Eth can be gotten from : https://faucet.egorfine.com/  or https://faucet.dimensions.network/.
